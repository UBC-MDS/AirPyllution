# AirPyllution
A package for visualizing future, historic and current air pollution data using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org).

## Summary
This package enables users to explore air pollution levels in locations around the world.   
Using the [Air Pollution API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution), this package provides 3 functions that help to visualise present, future and historic air pollution data. 

Using the OpenWeatherMap API requires sign up to gain access to an API key. The API key should be stored in the `config.py` file. (TO ADD)
For more information about API call limits and API care recommendations please visit the OpenWeather [How to start](https://openweathermap.org/appid) page.

## Functions
The functions are as follows:
- `getPollutionLevels()`
- `getHistoricData()`
- `getPollutionForecast()`

a summary paragraph that describes the project at a high level

a bulleted list of the functions (and datasets if applicable) that will be included in the package (this should be a 1-2 sentence description for each function/dataset)

a paragraph describing where your packages fit into the Python ecosystem (are there any other Python packages that have the same/similar functionality? Provide links to any that do. If none exist, then clearly state this as well).
